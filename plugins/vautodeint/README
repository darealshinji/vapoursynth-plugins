This is the README of the source code of VAutoDeint project. For a documention of usage,
see the comments in VAutoDeint.py

The external filter of this project has been compiled successfully under Visual Studio 
2012 in Windows 7 Professional SP1, however, it hasn't been tested under other platforms
and other systems. I myself guess it can be compiled under Windows XP using Visual
Studio 2008 or later, but I am not sure. Moreover, there is no script to compile it on
linux using MinGW, while any patch that help solve the problem will be always welcomed.

Special thanks to tricial, Myrsloik, Chikuzen, doom9 and all people who wrote the source
code I read to finish the project, and those who helped me with the algorithm of the
project.
