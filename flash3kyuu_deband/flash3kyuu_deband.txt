(I'm not the author of the original aviutl plugin, just ported the algorithm to
avisynth.)

This avisynth plugin debands the video by replacing banded pixels with average 
value of referenced pixels, and optionally add grain (random dithering) to them.

Supported colorspaces: YUY2, YV12, YV16, YV24, YV411 (Progressive only)

Parameters:		

range
	Banding detection range. 
	
	Default: 15

Y Cb Cr
	Banding detection threshold. If difference between current pixel and 
	reference pixel is less than threshold, it will be considered as banded.
	
	Default: 1 (dither_algo = 0) /
	         64 (dither_algo > 0)
	
grainY grainC
	Valid only when sample_mode is 1 or 2. Specifies amount of grains added in 
	the last debanding stage.
	
	Default: 1 (dither_algo = 0) /
	         64 (dither_algo > 0)
	
sample_mode
	Valid modes are:
	
	0: Take 1 pixel as refernce pixel. grainY and grainC are ignored.
	   (Deprecated, will be removed in future)
	1: Take 2 pixels as reference pixel. Reference pixels are in the same 
	   column of current pixel. Add grain after processing.
	2: Take 4 pixels as reference pixel. Reference pixels are in the square 
	   around current pixel. Add grain after processing.

	Default: 2
	
seed
	Seed for random number generation. 
	
blur_first
	Valid only when sample_mode is 1 or 2. 
	
	true: Current pixel is compared with average value of all pixels. 
	false: Current pixel is compared with all pixels. The pixel is considered as
	       banded pixel only if all differences are less than threshold.
	       	
	Default: true
	
dynamic_grain
	Use different grain pattern for each frame.
	
	Default: false
	
opt
	Specifies optimization mode. 
	
	-1: Use highest optimization mode that is supported by host CPU
	0: No optimization (should be supported by almost all CPUs)
	1: SSE2 (Pentium 4, AMD K8)
	2: SSSE3 (Core 2)
	3: SSE4.1 (Core 2 45nm)
	
	Default: -1
	
mt
	Multi-threaded processing. If set to true, U and V plane will be proccessed 
	in parallel with Y plane to speed up processing.
		
	Default: true if host has more than 1 CPU/cores, false otherwise.
	
dither_algo
	0: 8-bit processing (Deprecated, will be removed in future)
	1: No dithering, LSB is truncated
	2: Ordered dithering
	3: Floyd-Steinberg dithering

	* Visual quality of mode 3 is the best, but the debanded pixels may 
	  easily be destroyed by x264, you need to carefully tweak the settings
	  to get better result.
	* Mode 1 and mode 2 don't look the best, but if you are encoding at low 
	  bitrate, they may be better choice since the debanded pixels is easier
	  to survive encoding, mode 3 may look worse than 1/2 after encoding in
	  this situation.
	  (Thanks sneaker_ger @ doom9 for pointing this out!)
	 
	Note: 
	1. In sample mode 0, only mode 0 is available (it doesn't make sense to use
	   high precision mode). Setting this to other values will cause an error.
	
	2. It is not recommended to use mode 0 anymore (except that you want to use
	   sample mode 0). 
	   
	3. In high precision mode, threshold and dither parameters are 64 times
	   bigger than equivalent in low precision mode.
	   
	4. This parameter is ignored if output_depth = 16.
	   	      
	5. 10bit x264 command-line example:
	   avs2yuv -raw "script.avs" -o - | x264-10bit --demuxer raw --input-depth 16 --input-res 1280x720 --fps 24 --output "out.mp4" -
	   
	   Or compile x264 with the patch on https://gist.github.com/1117711, and 
	   specify the script directly:
	   x264-10bit --input-depth 16 --output "out.mp4" script.avs
	
	Default: 0 (sample_mode = 0) /
	         3 (sample_mode > 0)
	   
keep_tv_range
	If set to true, all processed pixels will be clamped to TV range 
	(luma: 16 ~ 235, chroma: 16 ~ 240). 
	
	It is recommended to set this to true for TV-range videos, since pixel 
	values may overflow/underflow after dithering. 
	
	DON'T set this to true for full-range videos, as all out-of-range pixels
	will be clamped to TV range.
	
	Default: false
	
input_mode
	Specify source video type.
	0: Regular 8 bit video
	1: 9 ~ 16 bit high bit-depth video, stacked format
	2: 9 ~ 16 bit high bit-depth video, interleaved format
	
	Default: 0 (input_depth = 8 or not specified) / 1 (input_depth > 8)
	
input_depth
	Specify bit-depth of source video.
	
	Range: 8 ~ 16
	Default: 8 (input_mode = 0 or not specified) / 16 (input_mode = 1 or 2)
	
output_mode
	Specify output video type. Meaning of values are the same as input_mode.
	
	Only valid when dither_algo = 1 / 2 / 3 . 
	
	If dither_algo = 0, output_mode is set to 0 and can't be changed.
	
	When output_mode = 2, frames will be 2x wider and look garbled on preview, 
	it will return to normal after correctly encoded by high bit-depth x264)
	
	Default: 0 (output_depth = 8 or not specified) / 1 (output_depth > 8)
	
output_depth
	Specify output bit-depth.
	
	Only valid when dither_algo = 1 / 2 / 3 . 
	
	If output_depth = 16, dither algorithm specified by dither_algo won't be
	applied.
	
	Range: 8 ~ 16
	Default: 8 (output_mode = 0 or not specified) / 16 (output_mode = 1 or 2)

random_algo_ref / random_algo_grain
	Choose random number algorithm for reference positions / grains.
	
	0: Algorithm in old versions
	1: Uniform distribution
	2: Gaussian distribution
	   (StdDev (sigma) is settable through random_param_ref / random_param_grain, 
	    Only values in [-1.0, 1.0] is used for multiplication, numbers outside 
	    this range are simply ignored)
	
	Default: 1 / 1
		
random_param_ref / random_param_grain
	Parameter for the respective random number generator. Currently only have 
	effect for the Gaussian generator.
	
	Default: 1.0

 * dynamic_dither_noise is renamed to dynamic_grain
 * precision_mode is renamed to dither_algo, mode 4 and 5 are removed
 * random_algo_dither is renamed to random_algo_grain
 * enable_fast_skip_plane is removed, this optimization will be enabled 
   implicitly whenever possible (Filter result won't be changed by this 
   optimization)

1.4.2 (2011-11-10)
 * Fixed crash on some non-mod16 videos

1.4.1 (2011-11-05)
 * Fixed broken YUY2 support (still slow)
 * Improved default value handling of bitdepth-related parameters
 * precision_mode 4 / 5 are now deprecated and may be removed in future versions, 
   you can use output_mode 1 / 2 to achieve the same result
 
1.4.0 (2011-10-30)
 * 9 ~ 16 bit-depth input/output
    * Related parameters: input_mode/input_depth/output_mode/output_depth
 * New random number generator, reference position and dither noise can be 
   generated in uniform or gaussian distribution
    * Related parameters: random_algo_ref / random_algo_dither
 * diff_seed is replaced with dynamic_dither_noise, when enabled, noise pattern
   will be different for each frame
 * Another new parameter: enable_fast_skip_plane
 * Short filter alias: f3kdb
 * Now the ICC-compiled DLL should be runnable on pre-SSE2 systems (untested)
 * Several bug fixes

1.3.0 (2011-09-07)
 * Added x64 version
 * Added a downsample filter: f3kdb_dither

 * Fixed a bug that high threshold values would produce incorrect result in
   high precision modes.
 * Threshold values was scaled based on other parameter in previous versions, 
   it is unscaled now to increase flexibility. Using same value has weaker 
   effect in new version. Effect of default parameter set is also changed. 
 * SSE optimization for high precision mode.
 * Rejects some invalid parameter combination instead of silently skips them
